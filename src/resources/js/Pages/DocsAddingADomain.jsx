            <Typography sx={{py: 1}}>Now StatsPro will be waiting to see a successful pageview event from the script that you installed on your site. It should only take a few moments for the event to show up. Refresh your dashboard and you should see your data flowing into StatsPro. If you don't see any data, it could mean that something was incorrectly setup when installing the script. Double check to make sure you've installed it in the right place.</Typography>
