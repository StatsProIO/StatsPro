            <Typography sx={{py: 1}}>This next step will depend on your hosting setup. Take the unique code that's shown to you and copy it into your website portal. Depending on your setup, this could be Wordpress, Shopify, Blogger, Jekyll, or something similar. Basically, the idea is that you'll need ths script to load when someone visits your site.</Typography>

            <Typography variant={'h4'} sx={{py: 1}}>5. Wait for a successful pageview</Typography>
            <Typography sx={{py: 1}}>Now StatsPro will be waiting to see a successful pageview event from the script that you installed on your site. It should only take a few moments for the event to show up. If you are stuck on this screen, it could mean that something was incorrectly setup when installing the script. Double check to make sure you've installed it in the right place.</Typography>
